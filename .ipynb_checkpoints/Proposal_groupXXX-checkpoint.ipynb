    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning has allowed us to do many things, such as detect anomalies or allow computers to see and analyze images. A typical application of unsupervised learning is when it comes to natural language processing. For example, researchers used unsupervised learning techniques to learn natural languages<a id=\"noteone\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#onenote). They used an algorithm called Automatic Distillation of Structure, which they used to teach a machine various things, from languages to protein sequencing. However, many of the inputs into the model they used were text data instead of audio data. Another group of researchers explored various unsupervised methods for teaching a machine natural language <a name=\"two\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#twonote). This research examined and compared how machines learn to how humans learn the language. However, the author states that the unsupervised approach to learning language is not well studied, and there is still a long way to go about the unsupervised learning of languages. Finally, another research group attempted to use unsupervised learning to detect variations in English accents. Unsupervised Model Selection for Recognition of Regional Accented Speech <a name=\"three\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#threenote).However, this research only accounted for accents localized to the United Kingdom. It did not account for accented English in other parts of the world. Also, many of the excerpts were, on average, 43 seconds long, and we would like to see if we can detect accents with less data. While these previous research ventures achieved excellent results, many did not consider the breadth of accented speech worldwide and their nuances. We want to explore accented English globally because it is more applicable to general human speech and nuances, which could be applied to speech recognition programs only trained in American English.

    "# Data\n",
    "The dataset that's going to be used in this project is the **Common Voice** dataset created by [mozilla.org](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets), and contains 10 variables, with a total of 90,474 observations. The dataset contains speech data read by the site's users, and is made up of audio clips from the users. The entire dataset is divided into two groups: \"valid\" and \"other\". In order for an observation to fall under the \"valid\" group, the audio clip must have had at least 2 listeners, and the majority of those listeners classify it with the audio matching the speech text it's read from. If an observation doesn't fulfill this criteria, it falls under \"other\". Though the observations will be evaluated equally in this project, it's important to note that some may hold higher weight in the algorithms than others. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, each observation includes `filename`,`text`,`up-votes`,`down-votes`,`age`,`gender`, and `accent`; however, in this project, the critical variables are `accent`, `up-votes`, and `down-votes`, since the aim is to cluster common voices based on their accent/locale. These critical variables are represented in the dataset by the user's reported region (e.g. \"United States English\"), the number of users who said that the speaker audio matched the speech text, and the number of users who said that the speaker audio did not match the speech text. </br>\n",
    "As for any special handling, we plan to convert each audio file into vectors using the `wave2vec` Python package [(github.com)](https://github.com/cristoper/wav2vec). Therefore, the audio files can be clustered properly once completed."

    "Since this dataset is open-source, and–therefore–permitted for public use, it's certain that the voices in the Common Voice dataset consented to be included; as a result, subjects included in the observations have informed consent. However, a identity concern may be the `filename` variable included in each observation, as they may include some identifying information of each user (e.g. their user IDs). To mitigate this problem, we won't include the `filename` variable in our evaluation, as it isn't considered a \"critical variable\". Excluding this part of the observations shouldn't hurt our outcome, and will protect the identity of each person included in the dataset. </br>\n",

    "In terms of biases, while the the age demographics of the observations being somewhat normally distributed, with a skew towards the young adult and middle age categories (20-29, 30-39, and 40-49 year olds), there is an *overwhelming* percentage of speakers that are male (45%), cutting female (17%) and other (2%) into a lower split. Despite having a considerable distribution of age, there's definitely collection bias present in this dataset, which may affect our evaluation outcome, as the pitch between the sexes could affect how the accents/locales are predicted. To counter this issue, we'll need to account for this confound when examining our results from the evaluations. </br>\n",
